     <h1>About Angel</h1>
     <p>Hi, I am Angel Ibanez, I’m a student at the University of Rhode Island and I’m majoring in computer science bs. I chose computer science since I was always fascinated by computers ever since my brother let me play minecraft when I was really young.
        I like a lot of stuff but my favorites have to be sports, and music. For sports I don’t really play them but I like to watch them especially Basketball and soccer. My favorite being soccer. I have watched it ever since I was a kid and my favorite team is Real Madrid. For music, I am very open to all kinds of music but my favorite genre has to be hip hop and my favorite artist is Kanye West
